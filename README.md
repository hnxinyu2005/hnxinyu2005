# Hi there!

## Welcome
Welcome to my GitHub profile.  
I wrote this markdown document to satisfy my curiosity as a newcomer to the GitHub community and to showcase who I am.  

## About Me
- **Education:** CS Student  
- **Home:** Hunan, China  
- **Skills:** Python, C++  
- **Hobbies:** Coding, Gaming, Music  
- **Contact:** ~~example @example.com~~  
> This feels like something a primary school student would write.

## Working On
**Q:** What am I probably doing right now?  
**A:** There are many possibilities, such as sleeping, playing games, coding, and so on. (This is just what I want you to see.)  

Oh, the email above is temporarily unavailable. I’ll leave a working contact method once I decide to keep updating on the GitHub community.  

## TODO
Too many to list.  
At least regarding this README, I just want to add some random stuff, like calling an API to show what game I'm playing. But by the time I wrote this line, I was getting ready to wash up and go to bed.  

I hope to become part of the GitHub family.
